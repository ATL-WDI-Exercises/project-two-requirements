## SECOND PROJECT

Now that you've wowed us with your Game projects, it's time to show off how creative you are (all while getting practical experience with Ruby and Rails!).

The objective of this project is to:

* Practice building basic Rails apps that connect to a relational (Postgresql) database
* Use RESTful routes
* Implement CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Destroy) functionality in an app
* Incorporate an authentication system


You will be working **individually** for this project, and you'll be designing the app yourself. Remember to keep things small -- scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for this project!

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

* Rails 4 app with Postgresql (`pg` gem + Postgresql on Heroku)
* Full CRUD functionality in at least one controller
* Authentication
* Include at least two models with at least one association
* RESTful routes

## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS
These are for extra credit! Don't forget -- you'll need to have your base app complete before you build any of these in -- so plan for different stages of your project, including one that meets only the core requirements.

* Style your app with Bootstrap/SASS
* Have multiple models/additional controllers
* Use an API -- Google Maps, Yelp, etc


## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

####Completed Project deliverables, due on demo day, Tuesday, September 22nd:

* Stories in Trello -- we'll be paying closer attention this time, so be sure to keep up with your Trello Board
* Link to Heroku hosted project
* Link to source code on GitHub


## TIMELINE

* Project cycle: Wednesday 9/16 - Tuesday 9/22
* Demo day: Tuesday 9/22
* Code reviews: Week 8

## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code is:

* Choose an app idea that is best suited for Postgresql
* DRY. Follow Ruby best practices!
* RESTful. Do things the Rails way.
* Well-formatted. Are you indenting well? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* Well-commented. Will I understand what is going on in each block or function?
* Clear. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?


Weâ€™ll also be looking at:

* Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you chose
a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourself. Were you able to make the app you pitched? What makes it exceptional?
